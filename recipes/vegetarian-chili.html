        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This vegetarian chili is still every bit as warm, comforting, and filling as a classic beef chili. Three types of beans do the heavy lifting in the chili and "beef" it up. It's filled with warm spices, and a jalape√±o adds a little extra heat. Add a second or keep the seeds in for even more spice!</p>
