        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Though falafel takes a little planning ahead to soak the chickpeas, it still couldn't be simpler. The fritters come out of the fryer super crisp and perfectly seasoned. Stuffed in a warm pita with lots of veggies, a drizzle of tahini and a dash of hot sauce, they make for a wonderful Middle Eastern weeknight dinner.</p>
