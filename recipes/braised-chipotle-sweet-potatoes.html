        <p>This super-easy weeknight dinner shows once and for all that braising isn't just for meat! Spicy, tender sweet potatoes simmer in a delicious sauce with stewed carrot pieces and slightly crisp kale. Perfect for vegans and carnivores alike, it's served with a sprinkle of crisp radish sticks and cilantro for a fresh finish.</p>
